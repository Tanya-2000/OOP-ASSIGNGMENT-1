#Discuss the ways in which inheritance promotes software reuse, saves time during program
development and helps prevent errors.
ANS: Inheritance allows developers to create derived classes that reuse code declared already in a base class.
 Avoiding the duplication of common functionality between several cases by building an inheritance hierarchy
 to contain the classes can save developers considerable amount of time. Similarly, placing common functionality
 in a single hase class, rather than duplicating the code in multiple unrelated classes, helps prevent the 
same errors from appearing in multiple source code files. If several classes each contain duplicate classes
 containing an error, the software developer has to spend time correcting each source-code file with the error. 
However, if these classes take ad vantage of inheritance, and the error occurs in the common functionality of
 the base class, the software developer needs to modify only the base class's code..
